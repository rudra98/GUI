# GUI
Graphical Interface using tkinter for the start.
Plus trying to work tkinter to make a standalone projects like Book Store Management System with database.

Also GUI doesnt only mean we should use tkinter, if we know python we can make it connect to javascript to make a exe file with js frontend as done in 'py with js' project.
